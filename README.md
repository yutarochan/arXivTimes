# arXivTimes

A repository for summarized machine learning papers (aka - *Sparknotes for Papers*). This repository attempts to maintain an English mirror of the [original arXivTimes repository](https://github.com/arXivTimes/arXivTimes).

**UPATE**: I am currently trying my best to port all of the contents from the original paper. If you know Japanese and would like to help port the contents over, please let me know.

* The length of the TL;DR should be enough to fit in a single tweet (~140 characters). The "ideal" TL;DR should capture the essence of the problem being solved, the solution/approach the author has taken and the results. Please try your best to help communicate the essence of the paper!
* If you are making a contribution for a specific paper, please designate yourself within the Assignees of the issue. This will help us to identify who has provided content and accordingly give credit.
* Use the Labels to tag the category of the paper accordingly. (Currently only contributors are only allowed to issue those tags, thus we'll take care of the tagging when submissions have been recieved.)
